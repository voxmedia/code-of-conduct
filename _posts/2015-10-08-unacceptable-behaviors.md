The product team is committed to providing a welcoming and safe environment for people of all races, gender identities, gender expressions, sexual orientations, physical abilities, physical appearances, socioeconomic backgrounds, life experiences, nationalities, ages, religions, and beliefs. Discrimination and harassment are expressly prohibited in our employee handbook. Harassment includes, but is not limited to, intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; sexist, racist, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory or derogatory language; and unwelcome sexual attention.

In order to provide such an environment, we commit to being considerate in our language use. Any behavior or language which is unwelcoming—whether or not it rises to the level of harassment—is also strongly discouraged.

Much exclusionary behavior takes the form of [microaggressions](http://www.vox.com/2015/2/16/8031073/what-are-microaggressions)—subtle put-downs which may be unconsciously delivered. Regardless of intent, microaggressions can have a significant negative impact on victims and have no place on our team.

The same goes for [tone policing](http://tooyoungforthelivingdead.tumblr.com/tone-policing), or responding negatively to the emotion behind a person’s message while ignoring its content (telling someone who is discussing an issue that makes them upset to “calm down” instead of responding to their concerns is an example of tone policing).

The language we use every day is frequently [tied to a past of violence and imperialism](https://bodhipost.com/violent-metaphors-arent-the-answer-4eaa73ad6f08); many of these assumptions are [built into the technology we use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA). Considering the invisible nature of people's pasts and how these things have affected them, we commit to [finding neutral replacements](http://users.clas.ufl.edu/hardman/peace.html) in our own work and [finding ways to limit exposure to these terms](https://github.com/voxmedia/sbn/pull/6263) via third-party sources. When reviewing these sources, we take these principles under consideration the same way we would consider their technical merits.

There are a host of behaviors and language common on tech teams which are worth noting as specifically unwelcome: Avoid “_well, actuallys_”—pedantic corrections that are often insulting and unproductive; make an effort not to interrupt your colleagues while they are speaking; never respond with surprise when someone asks for help; and take care neither to patronize your colleagues nor assume complete knowledge of a topic. This last point is especially important when talking about technical topics: Many women and people of color in the tech industry have many tales of being either [mansplained](https://www.guernicamag.com/daily/rebecca-solnit-men-explain-things-to-me/) about a field in which they are experts, or else excluded from learning opportunities because a colleague wouldn’t make an effort to answer questions—don’t be that person. Remember that your colleagues may have expertise you are unaware of, and listen at least as much as you speak.
