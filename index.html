<h1>Social Tables Engineering Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>The complete code of conduct can be read at <a href="http://code-of-conduct.socialtables.com">code-of-conduct.socialtables.com</a></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Social Tables Engineering team is committed to fostering a welcoming and supportive environment for all engineers and our colleagues, and we created this code of conduct to hold ourselves to this ideal. We do not anticipate bad behavior, but it is important to articulate our values and obligations to one another to reinforce our culture of collaboration and respect among the team. Having a code provides us with clear avenues to correct our culture should it ever stray from that course. We make this code public in the hopes of contributing to the ongoing conversation about inclusion in the tech community and encourage other teams to fork it and make it their own. For our team, this code is a living document and we commit to uphold and improve it as our team grows.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The contents of this code of conduct apply to our interactions in various areas of our shared professional lives, including the Social Tables offices, off-site company events, our Slack and email exchanges, social media, pull request feedback, and industry conferences or other events where we represent Social Tables.</p>
<h2>Values</h2>
<p>We want our team to be fun, productive, and safe for all members. In addition to the Social Tables <a href="https://www.socialtables.com/company/about/#values">core values</a>, there are several ways in which our Engineering team distinguishes itself.</p>
<p><strong>We work with and alongside other teams at Social Tables.</strong> Customer Success, Sales, Marketing, and Operations team members and others across the company are our peers and collaborators, not our clients. We maintain open lines of communication and foster good working relationships—indeed, friendships—with our colleagues. That collaboration is core to our success.</p>
<p><strong>We value so-called “soft” skills as much as “hard” skills.</strong> That is, we love code, but we recognize that writing code is not the only or most important way to contribute to great products. In fact, we object to the labels “soft” and “hard” because they imply one set of skills is more valuable than another. “Non-technical” is not synonymous with “inferior.”</p>
<p><strong>We value diversity.</strong> Diversity not only makes us a happier team, but evidence shows that diversity makes us a better, more productive team, too.</p>
<h2>Expected behaviors</h2>
<p>Every member of the Engineering team is expected to work hard, be considerate of their colleagues across the company, and contribute to a collaborative, positive, and healthy environment in which we can all succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Be supportive of your colleagues</strong>, both proactively and responsively. Offer to help if you see someone struggling or otherwise in need of assistance (taking care not to be patronizing or disrespectful). If someone approaches you looking for help, be generous with your time; if you’re under a deadline, direct them to someone else who may be of assistance. Go out of your way to include people in team jokes or memes, recognizing that we want to build an environment free of cliques.</p>
<p><strong>Be collaborative.</strong> Involve your colleagues – senior and junior – in brainstorms, sketching sessions, code reviews, planning documents, and the like. It’s not only okay to ask for help or feedback often, it’s unacceptable not to do so. Don’t succumb to either impostor syndrome (believing that you don’t deserve to be here) or <a href="http://xuhulk.tumblr.com/post/110549967516/stop-blowhard-syndrome">blowhard syndrome</a> (believing you can do no wrong). Recognize that in addition to asking for feedback, you are similarly obligated to give it.</p>
<p><strong>Be generous and kind in both giving and accepting critique.</strong> Critique is a natural and important part of our culture. Good critiques are kind, respectful, clear, and constructive, and focused on goals and requirements rather than personal preferences. You are expected to give and receive criticism with grace. If a discussion becomes emotionally charged, try <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/defusing-an-emotionally-charged-conversation-with-a-colleague">using these techniques</a> to defuse the situation and get the conversation back on track.</p>
<p><strong>Be respectful toward remote and IRL interactions alike.</strong> Every member of our team is out of the office (such as sick or on vacation) or working remotely at least some of the time. Adopt habits that are inclusive and productive for team members wherever they are: make liberal use of asynchronous forms of communication (such as Slack and email), use video hangouts when team members are not in the office together, document meetings and decisions thoroughly, and respect each others’ time off.</p>
<p><strong>Be humane.</strong> Be polite and friendly in all forms of communication, especially online communication, such as Slack and email, where opportunities for misunderstanding are greater. Use sarcasm carefully. <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/12/a-mental-trick-to-help-with-challenging-conversations">Tone is hard to decipher online</a>; make thoughtful use of emoji to aid in communication. Use video hangouts and IRL meetings when it makes sense; face-to-face discussion benefits from all kinds of social cues that may go missing in other forms of communication.</p>
<h2>Unacceptable behaviors</h2>
<p>The Engineering team is committed to providing a welcoming and safe environment for all people – people of all races, gender identities, gender expressions, sexual orientations, physical abilities, physical appearances, socioeconomic backgrounds, nationalities, ages, religions, and beliefs.</p>
<p>Any behavior or language that is unwelcoming is strongly discouraged. Such exclusionary behavior can take many forms, including <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/2/16/8031073/what-are-microaggressions">microaggressions</a>—subtle put-downs, whether deliberate or unconscious. Regardless of intent, microaggressions can have a significant negative impact on victims and have no place on our team.</p>
<p>There are a host of behaviors and language common on tech teams which are worth noting as specifically unwelcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid “<em>well, actuallys</em>”—pedantic corrections that are often insulting and unproductive;</li>
<li>make an effort not to interrupt your colleagues while they are speaking;</li>
<li>never respond with surprise when someone asks for help;</li>
<li>and take care neither to patronize your colleagues nor assume complete knowledge of a topic;</li>
<li>don’t presume to explain a topic without knowing whether someone wants or needs an explanation;</li>
<li>strive to be inclusive in learning opportunities and technical conversations;</li>
<li>listen more than you speak.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reporting a problem</h2>
<p>These guidelines are ambitious, and we’re not always going to succeed in meeting them. When something goes wrong, there are a number of things you can do to address the situation with your fellow Engineering team members or with Sam. We know that you’ll do your best work if you’re happy and comfortable in your surroundings, so we take concerns about this stuff seriously.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll be a witness to something that seems like it isn’t aligned with our values. Err on the side of caring for your colleagues in situations like these. Even if an incident seems minor, reach out to the person impacted by it to check in. In certain situations, it may even be helpful to speak directly to the person who has violated the code of conduct, a manager, or Sam directly to voice your concerns.</p>
<p>If you want to speak to a person impacted by an incident or to the person who has violated the code of conduct, but you’re not sure how to approach these interactions, try reaching out to Sam—these conversations are tricky, and Sam can help you figure out how best to approach them.</p>
<p>Depending on your comfort level and the severity of the situation, here are some things you can do to address it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Address it directly.</strong> If you’re comfortable bringing up the incident with the person who instigated it, pull them aside to discuss how it affected you. Be sure to approach these conversations in a forgiving spirit: an angry or tense conversation will not do either of you any good. If you’re unsure how to go about that, try discussing with your manager or with Sam first—they might have some advice about how to make this conversation happen. <br/><br/>If you’re too frustrated to have a direct conversation, there are a number of alternate routes you can take.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Talk to a peer or mentor.</strong> Your colleagues are likely to have personal and professional experience on which to draw that could be of use to you. If you have someone you’re comfortable approaching, reach out and discuss the situation with them. They may be able to advise on how they would handle it, or direct you to someone who can. The flip side of this, of course, is that you should also be available when your colleagues reach out to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Talk to your manager.</strong> Your manager probably knows quite a lot about the dynamics of your team, which makes them a good person to look to for advice. They may also be able to talk directly to the colleague in question if you feel uncomfortable or unsafe doing so yourself. Finally, your manager will be able to help you figure out how to ensure that any conflict with a colleague doesn’t interfere with your work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Talk to Sam.</strong> Sam is happy to talk to you about the problem and help figure out what steps to take. Sam is good at listening to concerns about small violations, but she’ll also be able to help out in situations where more drastic action needs to be taken.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Committing to improvement</h2>
<p>We understand that none of us are perfect: It’s expected that all of us, regardless of our backgrounds, will from time to time fail to live up to our very high standards. What matters isn’t having a perfect track record, but owning up to your mistakes and making a clear and persistent effort to improve.</p>
<p>If you are approached as having (consciously or otherwise) acted in a way that might make your colleagues feel unwelcome, refrain from being defensive. Remember that if someone calls you out, it likely took a great deal of courage for them to do so. Err on the side of not disputing your colleague. The best way to respect that courage is to acknowledge your mistake, apologize, and move on—with a renewed commitment to do better.</p>
<p>That said, repeated or severe violations of this code can become a People Ops matter.</p>
<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>Members of the Social Tables Engineering team are encouraged to contribute to this code of conduct in one of two ways: either by filing an issue to raise a concern or share feedback, or by opening a pull request with suggested changes. If you have a question or suggestion for evolving the code of conduct, file an issue outlining your suggestion, providing as much context as you can. If you’ve spotted a typo, discriminatory language, or any other change which could be more expediently handled via a commit, go ahead and open a pull request.</p>
<p>You may speak privately about a proposed change to your manager or a member of the Engineering leadership team before raising it here, if you like.</p>
<p>Team members are expected to watch this repo and are encouraged to contribute to discussions around changes. Note, of course, that contributions to the code and discussions around it are themselves governed by the rules of the code.</p>
<h2>Further reading</h2>
<p>In creating this code of conduct, we were inspired by the <a href="http://srccon.org/conduct/">SRCCON code of conduct</a>, the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual">Recurse Center User’s Manual</a>, and guidelines from the <a href="https://adainitiative.org/2014/02/howto-design-a-code-of-conduct-for-your-community/">Ada Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, we consulted many excellent resources, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Geek_Feminism_Wiki">Geek Feminism wiki</a> has excellent resources on feminism and its history within the geek community, including this outstanding <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Resources_for_allies">guide for allies</a>.</li>
<li>Christina Xu’s essay on <a href="http://xuhulk.tumblr.com/post/110549967516/stop-blowhard-syndrome">blowhard syndrome</a>, the evil twin to impostor syndrome. As Xu capably points out, while many of us do suffer from impostor syndrome, the reverse—the pathological belief that you can do anything—is arguably more destructive.</li>
<li>Kate Heddleston’s essays on <a href="https://kateheddleston.com/blog/criticism-and-ineffective-feedback">criticism</a> and <a href="https://kateheddleston.com/blog/argument-cultures-and-unregulated-aggression">argument culture</a>. In the former, Heddleston notes how criticism can be counter-productive and provides positive alternatives for effective feedback. In the latter, she describes argument culture, explains how it creates a toxic atmosphere, and provides constructive ways out—including adopting the “yes, and” improv mantra.</li>
